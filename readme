Projeto Crud Teste

Create, Read, Update and Delete 


CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. CRUD operations are basic data manipulation for database. 
We've already learned how to perform create (i.e. insert), read (i.e. select), update and delete operations in previous chapters. 
In this tutorial we'll create a simple PHP application to perform all these operations on a MySQL database table at one place.

Well, let's start by creating the table which we'll use in all of our example.


TODO: creating the database table
    - database name: company
    - table name: employees (id primary key NOT NULL Auto increment, name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, salary INT(10) NOT NULL)

TODO: Creating the Landing Page FOR our CRUD
    - create a index.php and put a template crud or make it by yourself.
    
TODO: Creating the Create Page
    - In this Section we'll build the Create functionality of our CRUD application.
    - Let's  create a file named "create.php" and put the form generate by bootstrap CRUD templates or make it by yourself
    - this page can be used to insert records in the employees table
    - The same "create.php" file will display the HTML form and process the submitted form data. It will also perfom basic validation on user inputs before saving the data.

TODO: Creating the Read page
    - Now it's time to build the Read Functionality of our CRUD application
    - Let's create a file named "read.php" and put the code inside and HTML template
    - It will simply retrieve the reocrds from the employees table based the id attribute of the employee.

TODO: Creating the update page
    - Similary, we can build the Update functionality of our CRUD application. 
    - Let's create a file named "update.php" and put the code inside and HTML template'
    - It will update the existing records in the employees table based the id attribute of employee.

TODO: Finally, we will build the delete functionality of our CRUD application.
    - Let's create a file named "delete.php" and put the code inside
    - I will delete the existing records in the employees table based the id attribute of the employee

TODO: At the end, let's create one more file "error.php". This page will be displayed if request is invalid ex: if id parameter is missing from URL query or it is not valid
